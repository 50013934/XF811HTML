		<h2>Web XR</h2>
		<p>The XR stands for “Extended Reality” which intended to include AR, VR and all other immersive technologies such as mobile devices with positional tracking or fixed display with head tracking abilities.</p>
		<p>WebXR is a new API standard for web developers to create VR or AR applications without having to deal directly with each hardware. Users can use only web browser to start viewing VR/AR content without having to install extra plugins or software. Developers can write the code once and it will work with all devices from different brands (Oculus, Vive, Windows Mixed VR, etc.)</p>
		<p>WebXR was introduced in 2018 and now being included in Chrome version 79 (WebVR is also removed) Based on MDN, the keys capabilities of WebXR are as follow (but not limited to)</p>
		<li>Recognize compatible VR/AR devices
		<li>Render 3D scene to the devices at an appropriate frame rate (usually 90 fps for headsets)
		<li>Mirror output to 2D display (eg. monitors)
		<li>Create vectors representing the movement of input controls (ex. move the scene based on head movement)
		<p>Most (if not all) of applications will be using WebGL as 3D rendering engine and Web Audio API for sounds. The output will be rendered into HTML canvas.</p>
		<p><b>Scan or click on the QR code below to see some examples of WebXR. You may be required to use a smartphone while visiting the page.</b></p>

		<h2>VR a Big Change in the Automobile Industry</h2>
		<p>
		If you have an automobile industry then you know that only a few models are kept in display and it is also difficult to show all the models to a particular customer. Also if the customer is confused between two or three-car then it is very difficult and it will be A wastage of time to take the drive of all three and check all the features of three and choose one. So to decrease the effort of your and increase the options for customers, virtual reality has given great advantage as it views the car in a 360-degree view. So that the customer can take test drives, select the exterior/interior, explore features, switch on lights, explore the accessories, etc this all through interactive experiences. If you give this experience to your customers then surely you will increase your business.

		<h2>Virtual Reality in Marketing Research</h2>
		<p>If you are a marketing researcher then you might be knowing that there are many difficulties in making the final product and fulfil the requirements of the project stakeholders. As they always have changed even if we give them our final products. So to overcome this VR provides a simulation. That helps the project stakeholders to study, suggest if any changes or fixes are required, this all at an early stage so that you don’t have to suffer after the product is ready and make the changes.</p>
		<p>Using VR will help in saving both times as well as cost and will also help in an as successful product launch.</p>
		<h2>The toughest thing that most of the business people face today:</h2>
		<p>The important and the toughest thing that most of the business plan face is how they should train their employees. If you want your employees to be trained well and in an industrial way then you should include the VR training. We all know that proverb “Tell me, I’ll remember. Involve me, I’ll understand”.  Hence you should give your employees the training in which they get involved in.
		<br>For this you can involve VR techniques, which will give you 3D experiences, and also will help your employees providing them real-world experience and real-world business problems. Using VR technology for training will train them with simulation and make them business-friendly and ready.
        <br>Hence seeing the above parameters, now you have to decide that isn’t virtual reality necessary for your business.

		<h2>How Virtual Reality is being used today</h2>
		<p>Unsurprisingly, the video games industry is one of the largest proponents of Virtual Reality. Support for the Oculus Rift headsets has already been jerry-rigged into games like Skyrim and Grand Theft Auto, but newer games like Elite: Dangerous come with headset support built right in. Many tried-and-true user interface metaphors in gaming have to be adjusted for VR (after all, who wants to have to pick items out of a menu that takes up your entire field of vision?), but the industry has been quick to adapt as the hardware for true Virtual Reality gaming has become more widely available.</p>
		<h3 class="indent">&diams;Virtual Reality and data visualization</h3>
		<p class="indent">Scientific and engineering data visualization has benefited for years from Virtual Reality, although recent innovation in display technology has generated interest in everything from molecular visualization to architecture to weather models.</p>

		<h3 class="indent">&diams;VR for aviation, medicine, and the military</h3>
		<p class="indent">In aviation, medicine, and the military, Virtual Reality training is an attractive alternative to live training with expensive equipment, dangerous situations, or sensitive technology. Commercial pilots can use realistic cockpits with VR technology in holistic training programs that incorporate virtual flight and live instruction. Surgeons can train with virtual tools and patients, and transfer their virtual skills into the operating room, and studies have already begun to show that such training leads to faster doctors who make fewer mistakes. Police and soldiers are able to conduct virtual raids that avoid putting lives at risk.</p>

		<h3 class="indent">&diams;Virtual Reality and the treatment of mental illness</h3>
		<p class="indent">Speaking of medicine, the treatment of mental illness, including post-traumatic stress disorder, stands to benefit from the application of Virtual Reality technology to ongoing therapy programs. Whether it’s allowing veterans to confront challenges in a controlled environment, or overcoming phobias in combination with behavioral therapy, VR has a potential beyond gaming, industrial and marketing applications to help people heal from, reconcile and understand real-world experiences.</p>
